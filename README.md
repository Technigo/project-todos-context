So in this project we made a very simple but effective to do app.
When you have completed the tast you press on the task and the taks is marked as completed. 
We wanted the to do app to feel like a to-do list so when you press on the task text then the task gets marked with "line through" so that it feels that you have marked it away with a pen.
we didn't have to push too hard for comptability to make it responsive as the site goes smoothly on mobile, ipad and desktop. 

One challenge we faced with using Zustand was understanding how to update the state correctly, especially when toggling the completed status or removing tasks. We fixed this by carefully reading the Zustand documentation and experimenting with how the set function works to make the updates smooth.
